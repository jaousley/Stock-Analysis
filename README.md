# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to refactor the code so that Steve can expand his dataset. Currently the code runs efficiently for a dozen stocks but Steve is interested in analyzing thousands of stocks at once. The goal is to reduce the number of steps in the code and make it easier for future users to read.

## Results
The refactored code allows for an analysis to be done quicker for data in both 2017 and 2018. The code overall was reduced by about 3 steps and is easier for those who did not create the code to understand. 

### 2017
As shown below, the original code ran in 0.2734375 seconds and the refactored code ran in 0.0859375 seconds

## Summary

- What are the advantages of refactoring code?
One of the advantages of refactoring code is it simply looks cleaner. It makes it easier to understand and follow along for future users and yourself later. Having less steps in the code is an advantage because it uses less memory and allows you to debug quicker when needed.  

- What are the disadvantages of refactoring code?
A disadvantage to refactoring code is that in can be frustrating. It can also be time consuming just to find out that the first attempted code is what works most efficiently in some cases. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
After I refactored the original VBA script it was easier for me to understand and remember the purpose of each section in the code. Because the original code was longer and not as detailed with comments it made it harder to reference when creating the refactored code. That made the process time consuming and frustrating.
