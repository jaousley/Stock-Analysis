# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to refactor the code by making the analysis run quicker, reducing the steps in the code, and making it easier to read for future users. This will allow Steve to expand his dataset. The original code was created to analyze about a dozen green energy stocks but Steve is now interested in possibly analyzing the entire stock market.  

## Results
The refactored code allows for an analysis to be done quicker for data in both 2017 and 2018. The code overall was reduced by about 3 steps and is easier for those who did not create the code to understand. Steve can use the refactored code to analzye data in less time. When applied to a larger dataset, the refactored code will save even more time. 

### 2017 Results
As shown below, the original code ran in 0.2734375 seconds and the refactored code ran in 0.0859375 seconds

## Summary

- What are the advantages of refactoring code?

One of the advantages of refactoring code is it simply looks cleaner. It makes it easier to understand and follow along for future users and yourself later. Having less steps in the code is an advantage because it uses less memory and allows you to debug quicker when needed.  

- What are the disadvantages of refactoring code?

A disadvantage to refactoring code is that in can be frustrating. It can also be time consuming just to find out that the first attempted code is what works most efficiently in some cases. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The original code was still effiicient for the data it was originally created to analyze but i was easier to get confused looking at the different steps without more detailed comments. Debugging the original code took longer because there were more lines of code to look through and change. The refactored code runs quicker but was time consuming to create. After I refactored the original VBA script it was easier for me to understand and remember the purpose of each section in the code.
